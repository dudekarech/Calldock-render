# 🚀 CallDocker Implementation Plan

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for CallDocker, a real-time WebRTC-based call routing and engagement solution. The plan is organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a complete, scalable system.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Turn websites into call centers** with embeddable WebRTC widgets
- **Multi-tenant SaaS platform** with company isolation
- **Scalable microservices architecture** using Rust
- **Real-time call routing** with IVR and queue management
- **Feature-based billing** system
- **Production-ready deployment** with Docker and Kubernetes

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Rust (Actix-web + Tokio)
- **Frontend**: Yew/Leptos (WebAssembly)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with multi-tenancy
- **Cache**: Redis for session management
- **Storage**: MinIO for file storage
- **Real-time**: WebRTC for audio communication
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes
