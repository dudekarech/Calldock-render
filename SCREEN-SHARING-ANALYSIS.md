## 🚨 **Potential Issues Identified:**

### **1. Screen Sharing Button Visibility:**
- Screen sharing buttons only appear during video calls
- If user starts with voice call, screen sharing option is hidden
- Need to ensure screen sharing is available for all call types

### **2. Screen Sharing State Persistence:**
- Screen sharing state might not persist across page refreshes
- Need to handle screen sharing state during call reconnections

### **3. Screen Sharing Quality:**
- No quality options for screen sharing
- No bandwidth optimization for different network conditions

### **4. Screen Sharing Permissions:**
- Basic error handling exists but could be enhanced
- No fallback options if screen sharing fails

3. **Ensure screen sharing works independently of video**

### **Phase 2: Screen Sharing Quality (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
1. **Add screen sharing quality options**
2. **Implement bandwidth optimization**
3. **Add screen sharing resolution controls**

### **Phase 3: Screen Sharing UX (LOW PRIORITY)**
1. **Add screen sharing indicators**
2. **Improve error handling**
3. **Add screen sharing shortcuts**

2. Answer from agent dashboard
3. Start screen sharing from agent side
4. Verify screen sharing displays on landing page

### **Test 3: Screen Sharing Quality**
1. Test screen sharing in different network conditions
2. Verify screen sharing resolution
3. Test screen sharing with different screen sizes

### **Test 4: Screen Sharing Controls**
1. Test start/stop screen sharing
2. Test screen sharing button states
3. Verify original video restoration
